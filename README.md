ofxMessagePack
==============

Implementation of MessagePack for openFrameworks (based on msgpack-c)

Note
----

There is an existing addon for MessagePack at https://github.com/hiroyuki/ofxMessagePack (from which I got the osx libs). That addon works a little differently than this one, so make sure to check that one out also and see which one you prefer.
